# Usage (IMPORTANT)
If you have downloaded the extension from the marketplace you must download the application in my <a href="https://github.com/AndySharp44s/Cristify-Downloader/releases" target="_blank">Github</a>, it acts as a server to download the songs, it has an easy to use interface and very configurable.  

In the future I will put the option to automatically see the updates, until then if you have any error be aware of my repository because I will upload updates as needed.

# Cristify Downloader
This program automatically installs an extension for Spicetify (you need Spicetify before installing this program) and creates an internal server. A background application waits for commands sent from Spotify to download any song or lyrics.

## Features
- You can select the audio quality.
- You can download lyrics.
- You can download songs, albums, or all songs from an artist.
- It includes an easy-to-use interface and buttons directly in Spotify, making song downloads a very simple task.
- You can access your profile and download your favorite songs, all your playlists, etc., with a single click.
- It can run automatically on startup.
- You can select the providers.
- You can listen to songs locally.
- Choose where to save all downloaded content.
- Many more configurable options.

## Dependencies
The only requirement is Spicetify; you can download it from [here](https://spicetify.app).
